# Contest Tracker App

A full-stack application built with **Next.js, Supabase, Python, Clerk, and Public APIs** to track coding contests, user participation, and YouTube solutions.

##  Features
- **Upcoming Contests:** View upcoming contests from Codeforces, CodeChef, and LeetCode.
- **Your Contests:** Track contests you've participated in across platforms.
- **Bookmarking:** Bookmark contests and access them from any device (persistent storage via Supabase).
- **YouTube Video Mapping:** Automatically map contest videos from the YouTube channel *TLE* with approx. 95% accuracyâ€”no manual intervention needed.
- **User Authentication:** Sign in via Clerk with Google. Custom Sign In/Sign Up forms are pending setup.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, ShadCN UI, Clerk (for authentication)
- **Backend:** Supabase (database), Python (for video fetching with `yt-dlp`), Public APIs
- **APIs Used:** 
  - Codeforces
  - CodeChef
  - LeetCode
  - YouTube (via `yt-dlp`)

## To Do
- **Clerk Custom Sign In/Sign Up:**  
  - Currently, only Google Sign-In is working. Custom forms are a high priority but are causing frustration. Need to revisit this later.
